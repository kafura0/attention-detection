# "IN THE WILD" DRIVER ATTENTION DETECTION

This repository shows how to perferm a head pose estimation in real time video footage. 
The project was intended to solve the problem of drowsy driving and thus a major requirement was that it works in "in the wild" situations. This determined the choise of the libraries used.
The following publicsation discusses in detail the research of the topic and the considerations involved: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334286261_Convolution_Neural_Networks_for_Head_pose_estimation_in_the_wild

The following packages are used:
* DockerFace - face detection Docker Solution Using Faster R-CNN
*
